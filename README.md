# Substrate Cumulus Parachain for BlockIQ®

1. What is the BlockIQ® DAO?

This is the transparent algorithmic protocol controlling the BlockIQ® DAO(decentralized autonomous organization), a non-custodial liquidity pool that generates value by tokenizing new data generated across the network, improving the BlockScore® Protocol’s overall accuracy affecting the loan interest and allocation of the BlockIQ® DAO. The BlockIQ® DAO allows assets to be staked to the liquidity pool utilizing a user’s BlockID® dNFT.

As users submit data for verification, they generate tokens in the BlockIQ® DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), a self-sufficient infinite liquidity pool where users are able to either claim or stake their tokens using their BlockID dNFT.

The BlockIQ® protocol algorithmically controls the BlockIQ® DAO. Users can borrow from the network by staking their BlockID® dNFT to the BlockIQ® DAO liquidity pool, which will leverage the value of the tokens attached to the users BlockID® dNFT.


2. How can we use the BlockIQ® DAO?

This is the parachain for BlockIQ®, which is to allow users to borrow and loan “stake” the tokens they generate after syncing their data with the network..

The functions the users can call via Polkadot.js are kinds of "Set/Get" named as below;
    Set : "set_ticket"
    Get : "get_ticket"
